            <h4>Learning Artificial Vocabulary</h4> 
            <p> 
              This study is a psychology experiment conducted by Reena Pauly from Dr. Falk Lieder’s  Rationality Enhancement Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:
              </p>
            <ul>
            <li> Be 18 years or older </li>
            <li> Be a fluent speaker of English </li>    
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. If you agree to participate in this study, you will complete a learning task at the computer. 
              The task involves memorizing pairs of words presented to you on your computer screen and reacting to them using the keys on your keyboard. 
              Completing the experiment will take approximately 17 minutes. You may quit the study at any time without penalty.</p>

            <p>Other than monetary compensation, participating in this study will not benefit you directly. But you will help us gain insights into how people interact with digital learning environments.</p>
              
            <p>If you participate in the study, you will receive 1.70£ for your time. Additionally, you have the opportunity to earn a bonus up to 0.80£ based on your performance. The average bonus will be 0.40£.</p>

            <p>Participation in the experiment poses no known risks.     </p>

            <p>Your Prolific ID may be connected to individual responses, but we will not be asking for any additional personally-identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. 
              We cannot however guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. 
              The data will be anonymized after the study is over, removing Prolific IDs. The anonymized data set can be stored permanently and may be passed on to other researchers.
            Please read over our <a href="../static/images/DataSheet.pdf", target="_blank"> data protection form </a> and save it if you want to.</p>

            <p>Please note that some participation data 
              may be collected and used by <a href="https://www.prolific.co/", target="_blank">Prolific</a>
              as per its privacy agreement: <a href="../static/images/Prolific_privacy-policy.pdf", target="_blank">PDF</a></p>
